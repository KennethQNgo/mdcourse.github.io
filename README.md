# Learn Molecular Simulations with Python

<img src="docs/source/_static/logo/logo-py.png" width="30%" align="right"/></a>

The goal of [Learn Molecular Simulations with Python](https://mdcourse.github.io/)
is to write a simple code containing most of the basic functionalities of molecular
simulations, such as:
- Energy minimization,
- Molecular dynamics,
- Monte Carlo move.

The Python code that is written here is used to realize molecular
scientific projects. Note that the code is slow and that efficiency is not the
primary objective here.

### Prerequisite

The target audience includes people who are either completely new to molecular simulations
or users of open-source codes such as LAMMPS and GROMACS who want to better understand
what is behind those codes. Although some basic knowledge of coding, thermodynamics, and
statistical physics is recommended for a full understanding of molecular simulations,
[Learn Molecular Simulations with Python](https://mdcourse.github.io/) can be followed
even without deep expertise in these fields. Annexes with key concepts and suggested
readings are provided as needed.

### What is not (yet) in the code

- molecules/shake,
- thermostats and barostats other than Berendsen,
- energy minimization methods other than the steepest descent.

### Author

- [Simon Gravelle](https://simongravelle.github.io/): computer physicist in soft matter and fluids at interfaces.

### Acknowledgments and license

### TODO

- Choose a different title? (Build Your Own Molecular Simulations with Python,
  Create Molecular Simulations with Python, Construct Molecular Simulations with Python)
- Find a cool acronym. MS-PyLearn, LMS-py ?
- add references
