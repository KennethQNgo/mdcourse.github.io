# Learn Molecular Simulations with Python

The goal of [Learn Molecular Simulations with Python](https://mdcourse.github.io/)
is to write a simple code containing most of the basic functionalities of molecular
simulations, such as:
- Energy minimization,
- Molecular dynamics,
- Monte Carlo move.

The Python code that will be written here will be used to realize some simple
scientific projects. Note that the code is slow and that efficiency is not the
objective here.

### Prerequisite

The target audience is people either completely new to molecular simulations, or
users of user-friendly codes such as LAMMPS and GROMACS wanting to better understand
what is hiding behind those codes. Although some basic knowledge in coding,
thermodynamics, and statistical physics is recommended to fully understand
molecular simulations, [Learn Molecular Simulations with Python](https://mdcourse.github.io/)
can be followed even without deep knowledge in those fields. Annexes with key
concepts and suggested readings are given when necessary.

### What is not (yet) in the code

- molecules/shake,
- thermostats and barostats other than Berendsen,
- energy minimization methods other than the steepest descent.

### About me

I am a computer physicist in soft matter and fluids at interfaces. You can
