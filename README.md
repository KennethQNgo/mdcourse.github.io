# Learn molecular simulation with python

The goal of [Learn molecular simulations with Python](https://mdcourse.github.io/) is to write a simple
code containing most of the basic-most functionalities of molecular simulations: including molecular
dynamics and monte carlo simulations.

The target audience are people either completely new to molecular simulations, or user of user-friendly
codes such as LAMMPS and GROMACS wanting to understand better what is hiding behind those codes.

The Python code that will be written here will be used to realize some simple scientific projects.

Although basics of coding, thermodynamics, statistical physics are necessary to fully understand molecular
simulations, Learn molecular simulations with Python can be followed even without deep knowledge in those
fields. Annexes with key concept and suggested readings are given when necessary.
