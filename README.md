# Step-by-Step Molecular Simulations with Python

<img src="docs/source/_static/logo/logo-py.png" width="30%" align="right"/></a>

The goal of [Step-by-S Molecular Simulations with Python](https://mdcourse.github.io/)
(MoleSimPy) is to write a simple code containing most of the basic
functionalities of molecular simulations, including:
- Energy minimization,
- Molecular dynamics,
- Monte Carlo move.

The Python code that is written here is used to realize molecular
scientific projects. Note that the code is slow and that efficiency is not the
primary objective here.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. Before you start, please read our
[Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines will help you
understand the process and expectations for contributing to the project.

### Prerequisite

The target audience includes people who are either completely new to molecular simulations
or users of open-source codes such as LAMMPS and GROMACS who want to better understand
what is behind those codes. Although some basic knowledge of coding, thermodynamics, and
statistical physics is recommended for a full understanding of molecular simulations,
[MoleSimPy](https://mdcourse.github.io/) can be followed even without deep
expertise in these fields.

### What is not (yet) in the code

- molecules/shake,
- electrostatic
- Monte Carlo
- thermostats and barostats other than Berendsen,
- energy minimization methods other than the steepest descent.
