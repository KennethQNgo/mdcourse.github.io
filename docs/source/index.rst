    The goal of *Learn Molecular Simulations with Python* is to write a simple code
    containing most of the basic functionalities of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.

    The target audience is people either completely new to molecular simulations, or 
    user of user-friendly codes such as LAMMPS and GROMACS wanting to understand better
    these codes.

    Although the basics of coding, thermodynamics, and statistical physics are necessary to fully 
    understand molecular simulations, *Learn molecular simulations with Python* can be followed
    even without deep knowledge in those fields. Annexes with key concepts and suggested readings 
    are given when necessary.
