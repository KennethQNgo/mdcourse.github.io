Learn molecular simulations with Python
=======================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

The goal of *Learn molecular simulations with Python* is to write a simple code
containing most of the basic-most functionalities of molecular simulations: including
molecular dynamics and monte carlo simulations.

The target audience are people either completely new to molecular simulations, or 
user of user-friendly codes such as LAMMPS and GROMACS wanting to understand better
what is hiding behind those codes.

The Python code that will be written here will be used to realize some simple scientific
projects. 

Although basics of coding, thermodynamics, statistical physics are necessary to fully 
understand molecular simulations, *Learn molecular simulations with Python* can be followed
even without deep knowledge in those fields. Annexes with key concept and suggested readings 
are given when necessary.
